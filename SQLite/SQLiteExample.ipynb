    "## What is SQLite?\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that stores data in a single file. It's perfect for:\n",
    "- **Small to medium applications** (websites, mobile apps, desktop software)\n",
    "- **Prototyping and development** (no server setup required)\n",
    "- **Data analysis and research** (portable databases)\n",
    "- **Embedded systems** (IoT devices, mobile applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages of SQLite:\n",
    "- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: No server installation or management needed\n",
    "- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS\n",
    "- ✅ **ACID Compliant**: Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable transactions\n",
    "- ✅ **Small Footprint**: Library is less than 1MB\n",

    "This tutorial demonstrates a **relational database** for earthquake ground motion data with three interconnected tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`event`** - Earthquake event information\n",
    "2. **`station`** - Recording station details  \n",
    "3. **`motion`** - Ground motion recordings (links events and stations)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Schema Overview:\n",
    "```\n",
    "event (1) ←→ (many) motion (many) ←→ (1) station\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **many-to-many relationship** through the `motion` table:\n",
    "- One earthquake can be recorded at multiple stations\n",
    "- One station can record multiple earthquakes\n",
    "- Each recording has unique motion characteristics"

    "## Step 1: Connecting to SQLite Database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`sqlite3.connect()`** creates or opens a database file:\n",
    "- If the file doesn't exist, SQLite creates it automatically\n",
    "- Returns a **Connection object** for database operations\n",
    "- **Best Practice**: Use context managers (`with` statement) for automatic cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "**`connection.cursor()`** creates a cursor object:\n",
    "- **Cursor** = pointer that executes SQL commands and fetches results\n",
    "- Think of it as your \"command interface\" to the database\n",
    "- Multiple cursors can exist per connection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling in Database Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `exec()` function below demonstrates proper error handling:\n",
    "- **`try/except`** blocks catch SQL errors (syntax, constraint violations, etc.)\n",
    "- **`sqlite3.Error`** is the base exception class for all SQLite errors\n",
    "- Always handle errors gracefully in production code"

    "## Step 2: Creating Tables with SQL DDL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding CREATE TABLE Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language)** defines database structure:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_name (\n",
    "    column_name data_type constraints,\n",
    "    column_name data_type constraints,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQLite Data Types:\n",
    "- **`INTEGER`** - Whole numbers (1, 42, -17)\n",
    "- **`REAL`** - Floating point numbers (3.14, -0.5, 1.2e5)\n",
    "- **`TEXT`** - Strings (\"earthquake\", 'station name')\n",
    "- **`BLOB`** - Binary data (images, files)\n",
    "- **`NULL`** - Missing/unknown values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Constraints Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`PRIMARY KEY`** - Unique identifier for each row\n",
    "   - Automatically creates an index for fast lookups\n",
    "   - Cannot be NULL or duplicate\n",
    "   - Use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` for auto-incrementing IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`FOREIGN KEY`** - Links tables together\n",
    "   - References the primary key of another table\n",
    "   - Maintains **referential integrity** (prevents orphaned records)\n",
    "   - Example: `motion.event_id` must exist in `event.event_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`IF NOT EXISTS`** - Safe table creation\n",
    "   - Only creates table if it doesn't already exist\n",
    "   - Prevents errors when running scripts multiple times\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Schema Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our three tables demonstrate a classic **many-to-many relationship**:\n",
    "- **`event`**: Stores earthquake information (magnitude, location)\n",
    "- **`station`**: Stores recording station details (location, soil properties)  \n",
    "- **`motion`**: Junction table linking events to stations with measurement data"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Data Insertion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Column Names**: Always specify column names for clarity\n",
    "   - `INSERT INTO event (event_id, event_name, ...)` ✅\n",
    "   - `INSERT INTO event VALUES (1, \"name\", ...)` ❌ (fragile)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Type Matching**: Ensure values match column types\n",
    "   - `magnitude real` expects numbers: `6.3` ✅, `\"6.3\"` works but not ideal\n",
    "   - `event_name text` expects strings: `\"Westwood Hills\"` ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Primary Key Management**: \n",
    "   - We're manually setting IDs here for simplicity\n",
    "   - In production, often use `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` for auto-increment\n",
    "   - SQLite automatically handles ID assignment if you omit the ID column\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Validation Tips:\n",
    "- **Coordinates**: Latitude (-90 to 90), Longitude (-180 to 180)\n",
    "- **Magnitude**: Typically 0-10 scale (Richter/Moment magnitude)\n",
    "- **PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration)**: Usually 0-2g for most earthquakes\n",
    "- **Vs30**: Soil shear wave velocity, typically 150-1500 m/s"

    "5. **Real-World Application**: Ground motion database for earthquake engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks for robust database operations  \n",
    "✅ **Safe Table Creation**: Using `IF NOT EXISTS` to prevent conflicts  \n",
    "✅ **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints maintain data consistency  \n",
    "✅ **Explicit Column Naming**: Clear, maintainable INSERT statements  \n",
    "✅ **Meaningful JOINs**: Combining related data for comprehensive analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Advanced Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexes**: Add `CREATE INDEX` for faster queries on large datasets\n",
    "2. **Transactions**: Use `BEGIN/COMMIT` for multi-statement operations\n",
    "3. **Parameterized Queries**: Prevent SQL injection with `?` placeholders\n",
    "4. **Database Migration**: Version control your schema changes\n",
    "5. **Integration**: Connect with pandas, matplotlib for data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Add indexes for frequently queried columns\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_motion_event ON motion(event_id);\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_motion_station ON motion(station_id);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Use parameterized queries for safety\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM event WHERE magnitude > ?\", (min_mag,))\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Use transactions for bulk operations\n",
    "con.execute(\"BEGIN\")\n",
    "# Multiple INSERT operations\n",
    "con.execute(\"COMMIT\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use context managers**: `with sqlite3.connect() as con:`\n",
    "- **Validate input data**: Check ranges, data types before insertion\n",
    "- **Regular backups**: SQLite files are easy to backup/restore\n",
    "- **Monitor file size**: Consider partitioning for very large datasets\n",
    "- **Test thoroughly**: Validate foreign key relationships and constraints"

    "### Critical Best Practices for Real Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving from tutorial code to production systems, several important practices ensure your database operations are **secure**, **reliable**, and **maintainable**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔒 **1. Security Best Practices**\n",
    "- **Parameterized Queries**: Use `?` placeholders instead of string formatting to prevent SQL injection attacks\n",
    "- **Input Validation**: Always validate data types, ranges, and required fields before database operations\n",
    "- **Access Control**: Enable foreign key constraints and use appropriate user permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛡️ **2. Error Handling & Reliability**\n",
    "- **Transaction Management**: Use `BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK` for multi-step operations\n",
    "- **Connection Management**: Properly close connections and handle connection failures\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**: Catch specific database errors and provide meaningful error messages\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: Validate business rules and data constraints before insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ **3. Performance Optimization**\n",
    "- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections for multiple operations\n",
    "- **Prepared Statements**: Compile SQL once, execute multiple times efficiently\n",
    "- **Indexes**: Create appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns\n",
    "- **Bulk Operations**: Use batch inserts for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏗️ **4. Code Architecture**\n",
    "- **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements or custom context managers for automatic cleanup\n",
    "- **Function Separation**: Separate validation, database operations, and business logic\n",
    "- **Configuration**: Store database paths and settings in configuration files\n",
    "- **Logging**: Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 **5. Data Quality & Validation**\n",
    "- **Schema Validation**: Ensure data matches expected types and constraints\n",
    "- **Range Checking**: Validate that numerical values fall within realistic ranges\n",
    "- **Required Fields**: Check for missing or null values in critical fields\n",
    "- **Referential Integrity**: Ensure foreign key relationships are maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Following Code Demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell shows a **production-ready implementation** that incorporates all these best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe Database Context Manager** - Handles connections, transactions, and cleanup automatically\n",
    "2. **Input Validation Function** - Validates earthquake data before insertion\n",
    "3. **Parameterized Queries** - Prevents SQL injection attacks\n",
    "4. **Error Handling** - Graceful handling of database errors with rollback capability\n",
    "5. **Data Range Validation** - Ensures realistic values for earthquake parameters\n",
    "6. **Foreign Key Enforcement** - Enables database constraints for data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach transforms simple tutorial code into **best-practice** database operations suitable for real scientific applications."
